# Java-UI-1-
A Java User Interface test example, using BorderPane, GridPane and StackPane elements. User input is read from text fields, after pressing a button.  The first text field takes in a URL and adds it to a ListView element.  The 2nd field prints out the input.  The 3rd field accepts a String and adds it into a Combobox, which is sorted. CSS stylesheets are used for simple layout make-up.
